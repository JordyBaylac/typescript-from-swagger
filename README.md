## Auto-generated TypeScript Swagger client (TS)

We will create a basic API using the Koa framework. This API will then communicate with an external Pets API using an auto-generated TypeScript Client. The Client is based on a external Swagger API definition

This project is composed of:

- **src/app**: the NodeJS API using Koa. It exposes only one method (*find-pets*)
- **src/services**: interface and implementation of the auto-generated TypeScript Client.

## Swagger Pets API

The Swagger API for this example can be found [here](https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json).

## Example

*Let's obtain the available pets!*

For that, we can test in POSTMAN and send a call to the REST endpoint:
```
http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/findByStatus?status=available
```

Above call returns an array with details about available pets.

The good news is that we can have type-safety and intellisense with the help of TypeScript. With an autogenerated client library (discussed in the next section) we ended up having this code:
```javascript
const pets = await petStoreApi.findPetsByStatus([Status.Available]);
```

## Autogenerating TypeScript from Swagger API
